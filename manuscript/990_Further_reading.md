## Motivation -- the first step to learning TDD

  - Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas by Mary Lynn Manns Ph.D. and Linda Rising Ph.D. is worth looking at.
  - [Resistance Is Not to Change](http://www.netobjectives.com/blogs/resistance-not-change) by Al Shalloway

## The Essential Tools

  - Gerard Meszaros has written a long book about using the XUnit family of test frameworks, called [XUnit Test Patterns](http://xunitpatterns.com/). This book also explains a lot of philosophy behind these tools. 
 
## Value Objects 

  - Ken Pugh has a chapter devoted to value objects in his book *Prefactoring* (the name of the chapter is *Abstract Data Types*).
  - *Growing Object Oriented Software Guided By Tests* contains some examples of using value objects and some strategies on refactoring towards them.
  - [Value object discussion](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ValueObject) on C2 wiki.
  - [Martin Fowler's bliki mentions](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html) value objects. They are also one of the patterns in his book [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html)
  - Arlo Beshele [describes](http://arlobelshee.com/the-no-mocks-book/) how he uses value objects (described under the name of *Whole Value*) much more than I do in this book, presenting an alternative design style that is closer to functional that the one I write about.
  - [Implementation Patterns](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780321413093) book by Kent Beck includes value object as one of the patterns.
